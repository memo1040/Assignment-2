    <br>
    <h3>Place of Birth and Hometown</h3>
    <p>I was born on the 24<sup>th</sup> of April of 1989 at 4:12<sub>pm</sub> in <b>Chula Vista, CA</b> at <em>Scripps Memorial Hospital</em> on H Street. I grew up in <strong>Mexicali, BC, Mexico</strong> and have resided there for most of my life, except for the 2 years my family moved to Chula Vista back in 2001, giving me the opportunity of attending Middle School in the US. We moved back to Mexicali in 2003, and it wasn't until 2015 that I went back to living in California on and off up until this day.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Upbringing</h3>
    <p>I grew up being <del>upper</del> middle class. Always attending private schools and living in the nice neighborhoods of town. There were hard times for the family economy every now and then, but my dad always strived to continue to give us the quality of life we were accustomed to. We certainly didn't live in luxury, but there was never anything lacking in our lives.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Family and Civil Status</h3>
    <p>My nuclear family is composed of both my parents, a younger brother, and myself. My brother has been married to Liz <small>(my sister-in-law)</small> for 3 years now, and just last year had his first kid. A beautiful son by the name of Santiago. I’m not married, have never been married, nor have any kids. I am though in a committed relationship and will <ins>hopefully</ins> get married in the next couple of months.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>I studied medicine at <i>Universidad Autónoma de Baja California</i>, where I graduated with a score of <mark>84.17</mark>, placing 18<sup>th</sup> out of 56. I decided to attend this school since it is considered amongst the top 10 in the country, it’s a public school so tuition wouldn’t be an issue, and it is located in my hometown. That way there wouldn’t be any excuses for me not to do well.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center; color: maroon; width: 75%;">Goals</h2>
    <p class="text">I hope to learn how to integrate myself into a multi-disciplinary medical team, improve my clinical skills and practice evidenced based medicine. All of this, along with using cutting edge technology to keep costs down for both the patients and institution.  In a Family Medicine residency, I hope to acquire the abilities and knowledge that will help me become the best primary care provider I can be.</p>
    <p class="text">Ultimately, I believe medicine is about helping other people.  I want to practice in underserved communities and utilize my bicultural and bilingual skills. Like the mixing of primary colors, I see myself as that secondary color who bridges the gap between citizen and immigrant, English and Spanish speaker, and most importantly between sick and healthy. It is my goal to provide care and guidance to all those that seek it, especially those who are sometimes unfortunately abandoned by the health care system. </p>
